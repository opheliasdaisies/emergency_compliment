  of you. Because the dictionary is not a picture book. Don’t be stupid.
- If you went to put money in a homeless man’s cup, and he grabbed your hand, all
  not cool-like, I’d slap his hand until he let yours go. I realize that’s a pretty
  specific scenario, but it if ever happens, just know, I got your back.

  of moving the world.
